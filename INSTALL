To install the CMSSW framework, please follow the procedure described for the DesyTtbarHiggsAnalysisFramework in the Section "Setting up the Framework in the recent Release". 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/DesyTtbarHiggsAnalysisFramework
No special release tag is required.

Except for some data files, only the subpackage "ZTopUtils" is required. It was originally part of the TtZFramework and was migrated there for common use.

On top of this, go to the CMSSW_X_Y_Z/src directory and execute
git clone https://github.com/jkiesele/WbWbXAnalysis.git
cmsenv
cd WbWbXAnalysis
./prepareEnv.sh
to set up and prepare the remaining parts of the framework. Here, you can ignore the warnings: "ls: cannot access testUnfold*.C: No such file or directory".
