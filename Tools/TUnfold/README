documentation on the TUnfold package:
=====================================
  arXiv:1205.6201
  http://www.desy.de/~sschmitt

Compiling remarks
=================
 * you need a running version of root installed on your computer
 * very old root version (say, less then 5.20) may be problematic
 * compiling has been tested on a linux system (scientific linux 5)
   it may or may not work on other systems

Compiling:
==========
 * for compiling the examples, type
     make bin
 * for compiling the library, type
     make lib
 * for compiling the manual "tunfold_manual.pdf", type
     make manual

Use of this TUnfold version
===========================
... in parallel to the existing (possibly outdated) version of TUnfold
which is shipped with your root version

 * make sure the header files
    TUnfold.h TUnfoldBinning.h TUnfoldDensity.h TUnfoldSys.h
   are taken from the local directory when included in your source code

 * make sure the library "libunfold.so" is linked to your code 

how it works:
 * the "original" classes of the TUnfold package which come with your
   root version, are named
    TUnfold TUnfoldBinning TUnfoldDensity TUnfoldSys 

 * the classes shipped with this package are named
    TUnfoldV17 TUnfoldBinningV17 TUnfoldDensityV17 TUnfoldSysV17

 * in the header files shipped with this package there are statements like
     #define TUnfold TUnfoldV17
       ...
     #define TUnfoldDensity TUnfoldDensityV17

 * in your code, use e.g. the class TUnfoldDensity. The #define statement
    translates this to TUnfoldDensityV17, so the new class is used.
