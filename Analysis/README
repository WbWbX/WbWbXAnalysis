To create the analysis executables, run the make.sh script.
This will compile all dependencies and the executables.

The executables (in ./bin) have help messages (-h --help) that explain
their usage

Their source code can be found in ./app_src

Control plots can be added in ./src/ttBarControlPlots.cc (refer to already added ones)
(Or -if you prefer- derive an own class from ./interface/controlPlotBasket.h. If you
do that, the class needs to be initialized and implemented in ./src/eventLoop.h, 
for reference search for all occurrences of "ttBarControlPlots" and "plots")


Event cuts and additional corrections are applied in ./src/eventLoop.h

If a new variable that is not already member of ./interface/NTFullEvent.h is supposed
to be plotted (and you don't want to calculate it from existing members, 
it needs to be added to the NTFullEvent in three parts of the file:
- private member: define it as a pointer to the event content of interest
- constructor: initialize the pointer with NULL
- reset() member function: set the pointer to NULL
This variable then needs to be associated to a "real" one in the event loop
(for reference search for evt.<someExistingVariable>=&)


Analysis plots (for differential cross sections, or inclusive...) are defined in
classes derived from ./interface/analysisPlots.h. For reference, see
./interface/analysisPlotsJan.h and ./src/analysisPlotsJan.cc

They make use of the NTFullEvent, too, and need to be initialized and filled.
For reference, see analysisPlotsJan and jansplots_step8





/////// some naming conventions /////////

all btag SF.efficiency files should be named <name>_btags.root
all discriminator input files should be named <name>_discr.root
all config files that are to be used with analyse should be named <name>_config.txt
